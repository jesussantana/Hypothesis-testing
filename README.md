### Description
Learn to perform hypothesis testing with Python..


### Level 1

- Exercise 1: 
  - Grab a sports theme dataset you like and select an attribute from the dataset. Calculate the p-value and say if you reject the null hypothesis by taking a 5% alpha.
  
### Level 2

- Exercise 2: 
  - Continue with the sports theme dataset you like and select two attributes from the dataset. Calculate the p-value and say if you reject the null hypothesis by taking a 5% alpha.

### Level 3

- Exercise 3: 
  - Continue with the sports theme dataset you like and select three attributes from the dataset. Calculate the p-value and say if you reject the null hypothesis by taking a 5% alpha.


### Targets

- Calculate the p-value of different variables or set of variables
- Interpret the p-value and say if it rejects the null hypothesis
